			<h3>Working with Forms</h3>
		</center>
	
		The three forms: Math Form, Reading Form and Writing Form, are what are used to generate reports based on
		student's results.<br/><br/>
		Each form is used to generate a report based on its corresponding subject for any of the grades or schools.
		The only exception to this is the Writing Form only generates data for 11th Grade because this is the only
		grade that takes this test.<br/><br/>
		To use these forms, you must select at least one grade, year or school.  Multiple selections can be made.
		In addition, at least one selection from gender, ethnicity, and proficiency level must be made.<br/><br/>
		Selecting options from the Student Characteristics section will narrow your search results.  Only one option
		from each row may be selected.  For example, you can not select "Has an IEP" and "Does not have an IEP" at
		the same time. You do not need to select any of these options to generate a report.<br/><br/>
		Once you have made your selections, press the "Show Report" button to view the report.  Press the "Close"
		button to return to the main menu.<br/><br/>
		Examples of what each form looks like is given below:
